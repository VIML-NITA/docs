Welcome to CuBot's documentation!
===================================

**CuBot** (/See.you.bot/) is a collaborative project, aimed towards unifying a multitude of discrete sensor driven modules for rapid prototyping of Customized Mobile Robots.
It is equipped with Two(2) Active Wheel Differential Drive structure, along with an A1M8 360 degree 2D Laser scanner model of RPLIDAR.
The platform also offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API for automated controlling of each individual hardware modules through simple ``Python`` scripting.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
.. how to :ref:`installation-1` the project.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.
